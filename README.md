My personal website.

Find it [here](scottmccullough.dev).

I am by no means a web developer, and even worse of a web designer. However this is an attempt to have at least something up and around.

Uses React, TS, and Material UI.

## Scripts

You can run:

- `yarn start`
- `yarn test`
- `yarn build`

## Development

Codebase is updated & maintained by Dependabot. Tested and deployed through GitHub Actions.
